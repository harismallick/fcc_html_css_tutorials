<!-- This tutorial is 8x longer than the previous one. Focus here will be on the new aspects being 
discussed. 
- Validating your html document: use a markup validation service. 
- W3C is the source you should be using for this.
- Variables and elements placed inside the head tag are not seen on the webpage.
- All tags can be modified using attributes. A list of all html attributes can be accessed here:

        </p>
        <h3>This is a sub-subheading</h3>
        <p>This is text under the sub-subheading. Different header sizes help give symantic meaning to the text displayed on the webpage. It helps give structure to the text.<br>
        Another way of separating the text into sections is by using horizontal lines. Like this: <br>
        <hr></p>
        <p>Block element tags naturally create a line break after their corresponding end tag. There are in-line element tags that can be used to manipulate text within the block tags. These include: <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>writing in bold</b></li>
            <li><i>writing in italics</i></li>
            <li><u>writing in underline</u></li>
        </ul>

            HTML entities: <br>
            HTML uses symbols in its syntax which cannot be written out as plain text. To write them as plain text, entities need to be used that represent them. These can be studies further at the following link: <br>

            Adding abbreviations to html: <br>
            This is achieved using the &lt;abbr&gt; in-line element. You can write the abbreviation, and when the end-user hovers over the abbreviated text, they will be able to see the full version. For example: <br>
            <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr><br>
            <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr><br>
            <b>Disclaimer:</b> this feature may not be available on all screen readers. So don't abbreviate words that are essential to understanding the text on the page.

            There are three types of lists that can be created in HTML:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Ordered lists - The different elements are separated by numbers.</li>
                <li>Unordered lists - The different elements are separated by bullets.</li>
                <li>Description lists - There are instantiated with &lt;dl&gt; tag.<br>
                These lists contain elements under two tags: the description term (instantiated with &lt;dt&gt;) and the description (created with &lt;dd&gt;)</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Country</dt>
                <dd>Area of land enclosed within national borders is considered a country.</dd>
                <dt>State</dt>

            <h2>Adding links to html pages</h2>
            <br><br>
            Unintuitively, you do not use the &lt;link&gt; tag to add links to other webpages to your html page. You actually use the &lt;a&gt; tag, which stands for 'anchor'. It anchors a web link to a section of text in your html.<br>
            Here is an example:<br>
            <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a></abbr><br><br>
            The 'href' attribute is needed to link the webpage to the desired text.<br>
            The reference link that you anchor can be absolute or relative. Relative references are best used when you want to link documents, images, other html pages that are present in the same directory on your computer or the server.<br>
            Linking the icon and the stylesheet are examples of relative references used in this example.<br>

        <h2>Chapter 6: Adding images to html pages</h2>
        <p>
            Here we will learn good practices for adding images to the web page. They are added using the &lt;img&gt; tag. The essential attribute is 'src', which is like 'href' for links. Other attributes include:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>alt: use this to add descriptive text that will be printed if the image source is corrupted.</li>
                <li>title: give a unique name/id to the image that is not displayed to the user but can be used for backend applications.</li>
                <li>height and width: exact pixel values can be provided for how much space the image will take. This is considered good practice for webpages where periodic ads apprear. Giving a fixed height and width will prevent the image for being shifted on the webpage due to a pop-up ad.</li>
                <li>loading: This attribute determines how quickly an image should be loaded on the webpage. By default, this is set to 'eager', which means the image will be loaded well before the user scrolls down the fold to the image. When set to 'lazy', image will only load just before the user is going to scroll below the fold to it. This setting is good for performance optimisation.</li>
                <li>Using the figure tag indents the image on the webpage. You can add caption underneath the image within the figure tag, using the figcaption tag.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <figure>
            <img src="img/html_logo_300x300.png" alt="HTML 5 Logo" title="Learning to add images to html" width="300" height="300">
            <figcaption>This is the HTML 5 logo.</figcaption>
            <p>
                <code>
                    &lt;h1&gt;Example code&lt;/h1&gt;
                </code><br>
                Can display code snippets inside the figure tags, using the code tag.
            </p>

        <h2>Adding semantic tags to your html page</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Semantic tags help give stucture to the information presented on the website, help with the flow and help divide the information into sections.</li>
                <li>Can use the header, main and footer tags to divide the html page into appropriate sections.</li>
                <li>The 'section' or 'article' tags can be used to enlose text and media that correspond to a particular topic in the webpage.</li>
                <li>The time tag is used to indicate a block of text as displaying date and/or time. This does not change the way the text is displayed on the page, but can be useful for backend applications and screen readers. Need to use the datetime attribute, like: <time datetime="08:00">8 am</time></li>
                <li>The mark tag is used to hightlight text on the page. <mark>For example</mark></li>
                <li>Div and span are not semantic elements, but are commonly used.</li>
            </ul>

                        It generate a drop down text box which displays information, should the user choose to read it. An example of use for this would be for warranty information, or further information that is not essential to display in the first instance.
