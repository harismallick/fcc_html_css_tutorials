<!-- This tutorial is 8x longer than the previous one. Focus here will be on the new aspects being 
discussed. 
- Validating your html document: use a markup validation service. 
- W3C is the source you should be using for this.
- Variables and elements placed inside the head tag are not seen on the webpage.
- All tags can be modified using attributes. A list of all html attributes can be accessed here:

        <link rel="icon" href="logo.png" type="image/x-icon">
        <!-- <style> 
            html {

            body {

                color: whitesmoke;
            }
        </style> -->
        <!-- Another way of stylising the html page is by importing a CSS template by using the link tag, as shown for the icon. -->
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css" type="text/css">

    <body>
        <h1>This is the title</h1>
        <h2>This is a subheading</h2>

        <p><!-- A quick way to create the html tags in VS Code is to write the letter of the tag
            and then press tab. The auto code complete will automatically add the <> and end tag. -->
            This is example text under the subheading.
        </p>
        <h3>This is a sub-subheading</h3>
        <p>This is text under the sub-subheading. Different header sizes help give symantic meaning to the text displayed on the webpage. It helps give structure to the text.<br>
        Another way of separating the text into sections is by using horizontal lines. Like this: <br>
        <hr></p>
        <p>Block element tags naturally create a line break after their corresponding end tag. There are in-line element tags that can be used to manipulate text within the block tags. These include: <br>
        <ul>
            <li><b>writing in bold</b></li>
            <li><i>writing in italics</i></li>
            <li><u>writing in underline</u></li>
        </ul>
        
        </p>
        <p>
            HTML entities: <br>
            HTML uses symbols in its syntax which cannot be written out as plain text. To write them as plain text, entities need to be used that represent them. These can be studies further at the following link: <br>

        </p>
        <p>
            Adding abbreviations to html: <br>
            This is achieved using the &lt;abbr&gt; in-line element. You can write the abbreviation, and when the end-user hovers over the abbreviated text, they will be able to see the full version. For example: <br>
            <abbr title="Great Britain">GB</abbr><br>
            <abbr title="United States of America">USA</abbr><br>
            <b>Disclaimer:</b> this feature may not be available on all screen readers. So don't abbreviate words that are essential to understanding the text on the page.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are three types of lists that can be created in HTML:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Ordered lists - The different elements are separated by numbers.</li>
                <li>Unordered lists - The different elements are separated by bullets.</li>
                <li>Description lists - There are instantiated with &lt;dl&gt; tag.<br>
                These lists contain elements under two tags: the description term (instantiated with &lt;dt&gt;) and the description (created with &lt;dd&gt;)</li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
                <dt>Country</dt>
                <dd>Area of land enclosed within national borders is considered a country.</dd>
                <dt>State</dt>
                <dd>This is an area of land within a country that has its own governance under national governance.</dd>
            </dl>
        </p><hr>

            <h2>Adding links to html pages</h2>
            <br><br>
            Unintuitively, you do not use the &lt;link&gt; tag to add links to other webpages to your html page. You actually use the &lt;a&gt; tag, which stands for 'anchor'. It anchors a web link to a section of text in your html.<br>
            Here is an example:<br>
            <abbr title="Mozilla Developer Network"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/" target="_blank">MDN</a></abbr><br><br>
            The 'href' attribute is needed to link the webpage to the desired text.
